# solvekdv: Korteweg-de Vries IMEX solver
Connor P. Duffin

My own implementation of a KdV solver using the Implicit-Explicit method of
Durrand & Blossey (2012). See the python notebooks in `docs` to see how
the equations that need to be solved.

Requires:

  * `matplotlib`
  * `scipy` library
  * `numpy`
